# This is my practice document
I am hoping to increase my Git Fu with a short 1-hour course at the Investigative Reporters and Editors Computer Assisted Reporting [NICAR](http://ire.org) conference in Chicago.

Nothing more to see here, _really_. 

This is a branch of the readme.

There is NO data to put there!

There's no actual data yet. Because this is not a real project.

## This is where my data analysis will be described.

Maybe not. Since there's still no actual data analysis going on here.
